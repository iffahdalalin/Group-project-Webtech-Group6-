### PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Heavenly Treats is a baking store that will be selling nutritious homemade cookies that will haunt people’s taste and engage customers into repeating their orders. The difference between our shop and others is the quality of the nutrition itself. We will be providing numerous services that will give a lot of choices for customers to choose from.

Through the website of our store, potential customers will be able to view the menu, fill in their orders and give feedback. The header will be shown on every page of the website, where customers will be able to navigate to four pages: Home, Service, My Cart and Contact Us. The details of the operating hours, services and the comment section will appear on the homepage. A short introduction about the shop will also be mentioned there.

The next part after the homepage is the Service Navigation page. It will be the page that guides users to further parts; Menu, Custom Cookies, Special Package, and Add-ons. Customers can choose either one or more services to order the cookies. Menu page displays the ready to order cookies that can be ordered anytime. Otherwise, customers are able to customize the order based on its amount, dough, icing, and topping. The next page will show the Special Packages which provides buyers to choose the cookie gift set packed in hampers or parcels. The Add-ons page will let the buyers add two optional items to their cart, a personalized card and a custom packaging, where they will be able to pick from different options and write custom messages.

The last page, Contact Us, will display a feedback form in which users will have to fill in their details to submit their messages. The store’s contact details, a Google Maps embed of the store location and social media links will also be displayed on the page.
